# TypeScript Type Error in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and provides a solution.

The bug involves a function that expects two numbers as parameters but receives a string and a number.  This leads to a type error during compilation. The solution involves adding type guards to ensure that the function parameters are of the correct type.
